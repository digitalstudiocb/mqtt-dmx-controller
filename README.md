## Usage

Should be quite self-explanatory when you're experienced with DMX Controllers. If you have questions please open a 
[Issue](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/mqtt-dmx-controller/issues/new).

Beside the normal operation like many other DMX Controllers it's also possible to use MQTT to set channel values, 
activate scenes and control sequences. The topics and payloads used for this are the same as described in the
[mqtt-dmx-sequencer](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/mqtt-dmx-sequencer) documentation.

* [mqtt-dmx-sequencer](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/mqtt-dmx-sequencer) - the headless counterpart to this 
Software. You can export scene- and sequence-files from mqtt-dmx-controller that can be used with the mqtt-dmx-sequencer 
for fully automated and headless DMX Control.
* [artnet](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/artnet) - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) module that can be used to send ArtDMX 
packages to an [Art-Net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net) node.
